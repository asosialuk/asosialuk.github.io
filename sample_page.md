## Global CO2 Emmissions:Trends & Insights 

**Project description:** The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of global CO2 emissions, highlighting key trends and regional disparities.

### 1. Key observations: 

1. China and United States are the biggest CO emitters. Their combined emissions account for significant portion of global total.
2. CO2 emmissions per capita vary widely.  While some countirs have high emissions due to theire large populations, others have much higher per capita emissions, indicating greater energy consumption and industrial activity per person.
3. Global CO2 emissions have inscreased over time. This trend is driven by population growth, economic development and increased energy consumption.
4. There are some disparities in CO2 emissions. Developed countries generally have higher per capita emmissions that developing countries.

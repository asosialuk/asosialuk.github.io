## Global CO2 Emmissions:Trends & Insights 

**Project description:** The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of global CO2 emissions, highlighting key trends and regional disparities.

### 1. Key observations: 

1. China and United States are the biggest CO emitters. Their combined emissions account for significant portion of global total.
2. CO2 emmissions per capita vary widely.  While some countirs have high emissions due to theire large populations, others have much higher per capita emissions, indicating greater energy consumption and industrial activity per person.
3. Global CO2 emissions have inscreased over time. This trend is driven by population growth, economic development and increased energy consumption.
4. There are some disparities in CO2 emissions. Developed countries generally have higher per capita emmissions that developing countries. 

### 2. Highlights:

* The map effectively shows the distribution of CO2 emissions across the globe.    
* The scatter plot highlights the relationship between population and CO2 emissions, revealing that some countries have high emissions due to their large populations, while others have high per capita emissions.    
* The line chart shows the trend of global CO2 emissions over time, indicating a steady increase.

### 3. Further recommended analysis: 
* It would also be useful to see how CO2 emissions per capita have changed over time.
* It would be helpful to have more information on the factors driving CO2 emissions in different countries.

### 4. Recommendations:
* Countries should continue to invest in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures to reduce CO2 emissions.
* International cooperation is essential to address the global challenge of climate change.
* Individuals can also play a role in reducing CO2 emissions by making sustainable choices in their daily lives.
